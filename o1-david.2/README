This project is structured around 3 files:

main.c
producer.c
consumer.c

"make" will compile all 3.

"make clean" will clear out all executables and remove all .log files 
that may have been created by producers and consumers

usage: 

"./master XX" where XX is the number of consumers you want to run

There's also some bash files for cleaning up memory.

bashTest searches through lsof and kills all processes associated with "o1-david"

removeMem also searches through and calls ipcrm and kills the associated shmid's

NOTE:

I was unable to complete the final bash script to compile statistics
