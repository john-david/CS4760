This project is not working correctly, and I'm almost embarrassed to turn it in in its current state, but I ran out of time after
having some scheduling issues due to a personal matter I had to deal with outside of school.   

I had lots of trouble getting the process scheduler and blocks to work correctly. I had troubles getting it to work on one process.
I also had some trouble with the clock setup. I had  users spawning, talking to the OSS, etc. shared memory for process blocks,
message queues to send things back and forth, some code to move processes to the schedule (not working) and have routines
to shut everything down. 

______________________________

OSS: Usage: ./oss

This program is set up around 3 files.

oss.c - main program which spawns users, shared memory, processblocks
user.c - runs user code, which increments clock
utility.h - holder for utility functions and libraries
utility.c - connected to utility.h

./oss will run the program
