The main files are oss.c, oss.h, user.c

"make" will compile the set.

To run, use "./oss"

The following options are available:

-h help -- shows options

-u [processes]  This sets the max number of processes used in the system. Default is 18

-t [segfault %]  This is a configurable percentage for segfault. This will be passed to each process. Default is randomly set (1-5) 

 
The basic shared memory structure completed. 

The number of processes and segfault percentages are configuable. 

Processes are spawned and killed.

Left to do: implement memory management and gather statistics
