This directory is set up in the following manner:


runsim.c and testsim.c both run according to the exercise in the book.

makeargv.c is only used as a helper program for runsim.c 

proc_fan.c runs the compiled versions of runsim.c and testsim.c 
per the given instructions from both the spec sheet
and the instructions given in class.

For example, the command "proc_fan -n 20" will run runsim.c calling 
20 processes using the testing.data file. 
As described in class, the command "proc_fan -n 20 -f filename" will run runsim calling 20 processes using a user provided file.

Per the instructions, getopt was used in the proc_fan.c file to read
command line instructions.

"make all" will compile the  program into an exec named proc_fan
"make clean" will remove all executibles from the directory.
